## Introduction

HikeOn is a powerful tool for organizing outdoor activities with ease and confidence. Perfect for planning picnics, hikes, and other nature-focused outings, this app combines convenience and safety. Users simply enter the type of event they’re planning—like a “hiking trip” or “picnic”—and the app provides curated location options, real-time weather data, and AI-driven safety tips specific to their chosen activity.

Utilizing OpenWeather for accurate forecasts, Google Maps for nearby locations, and the OpenAI API for intelligent safety advice, the app ensures that users have everything they need for a successful outing. For added peace of mind, an optional emergency contact feature enables users to quickly send their location to friends or family, enhancing safety on every adventure. Whether you’re a seasoned hiker or planning a casual day out, the Outdoor Event Planner and Safety Guide is your all-in-one solution for safe and memorable outdoor experiences.
